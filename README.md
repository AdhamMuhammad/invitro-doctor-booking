How I Used AI Tools:

I used AI tools (ChatGPT) as my primary coding assistant throughout the project. I didn’t start the project entirely from scratch, instead i:

- Prompted ChatGPT to generate core logic and components like the appointment card, date/time parsing, and Zustand store.
- Used AI suggestions as a foundation, then edited and customized the code to fit my project’s needs.
- Debugged AI-generated code manually and made improvements to better match design and user experience goals.
